## Note
This project is designed for Google Cloud Platform (GCP). After training, the prediction function and the trained models need to be uploaded to GCP. The trigger obtained from GCP is used for the client-side requester, and the output is displayed accordingly.

The GUI requester is still missing, so once the project is completed, it will be updated.
